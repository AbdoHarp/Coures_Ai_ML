#)*** Getting Ready
# Write a program that does the following in order:
# - Asks the user to enter a number “x”
# - Asks the user to enter a number “y”
# - Prints out number “x”, raised to the power “y”.
# - Prints out the log (base 2) of “x”  ***

import math

x = int(input("Enter a number 1: "))
y = int(input("Enter a number 2: "))

if x**y :
    print(x**y)
else:
    print("cant by x raised to for y")

print(math.log2(x))
